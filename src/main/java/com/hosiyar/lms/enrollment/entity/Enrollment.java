/**
 * Links a student to a course - and that is its entire reason to exist.
 *
 * Note there are no JPA relationships here at all. Both the student and the
 * course live in other modules, so both are referenced by plain UUID and
 * resolved through those modules' public interfaces. This is the purest
 * example of ADR-006 in the whole project: an entity whose only job is to
 * join two modules, doing it without a single foreign key across a boundary.
